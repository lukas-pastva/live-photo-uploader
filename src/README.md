Implementation
1. Setting Up the Flask App
app.py

python
Copy code
from flask import Flask, render_template, request, redirect, url_for
import os

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'] = 'uploads'

# Ensure the upload directory exists
os.makedirs(app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'], exist_ok=True)
2. Handling File Uploads
We need to handle file uploads and save them in the appropriate directories.

app.py (continued)

python
Copy code
ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS = {'heic', 'jpg', 'jpeg', 'png', 'mov', 'mp4'}

def allowed_file(filename):
    return '.' in filename and \
           filename.rsplit('.', 1)[1].lower() in ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS
Upload Route

python
Copy code
@app.route('/upload/<category>', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def upload_file(category):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        # Check if the post request has the file part
        if 'photo' not in request.files:
            return 'No file part', 400
        file = request.files['photo']
        if file.filename == '':
            return 'No selected file', 400
        if file and allowed_file(file.filename):
            # Save the original file
            category_path = os.path.join(app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'], category, 'source')
            os.makedirs(category_path, exist_ok=True)
            filepath = os.path.join(category_path, file.filename)
            file.save(filepath)

            # Process the file
            process_file(filepath, category)

            return redirect(url_for('category_view', category=category))
    return render_template('upload.html', category=category)
3. Processing Apple Photo Formats
We need to handle HEIC and Live Photos. For HEIC, we'll use pyheif. For Live Photos (which come as a combination of a still image and a video), we'll need to handle both components.

Install Dependencies

In your requirements.txt:

Copy code
Flask
Pillow
pyheif
System Dependencies

Install libheif:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt-get install libheif1 libheif-dev
Processing Function

python
Copy code
import pyheif
from PIL import Image

def process_file(filepath, category):
    filename = os.path.basename(filepath)
    name, ext = os.path.splitext(filename)
    ext = ext.lower()

    if ext == '.heic':
        heif_file = pyheif.read(filepath)
        image = Image.frombytes(
            heif_file.mode,
            heif_file.size,
            heif_file.data,
            "raw",
            heif_file.mode,
            heif_file.stride,
        )
    else:
        image = Image.open(filepath)

    # Generate different resolutions
    sizes = {
        'largest': (1920, 1080),
        'medium': (1280, 720),
        'thumbnail': (200, 200),
    }

    for size_name, size in sizes.items():
        img_copy = image.copy()
        img_copy.thumbnail(size)
        save_dir = os.path.join(app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'], category, size_name)
        os.makedirs(save_dir, exist_ok=True)
        save_path = os.path.join(save_dir, f'{name}.jpeg')
        img_copy.save(save_path, 'JPEG')
4. Generating JPEG Variants
The process_file function already generates JPEG variants in different sizes.

5. Category Management
Routes for Category Management

python
Copy code
@app.route('/')
def index():
    categories = os.listdir(app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'])
    return render_template('index.html', categories=categories)

@app.route('/category/<category>')
def category_view(category):
    # Display images in the category
    thumbnails_dir = os.path.join(app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'], category, 'thumbnail')
    images = os.listdir(thumbnails_dir) if os.path.exists(thumbnails_dir) else []
    return render_template('category.html', category=category, images=images)

@app.route('/category/create', methods=['POST'])
def create_category():
    category = request.form.get('category_name')
    if category:
        category_path = os.path.join(app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'], category)
        os.makedirs(category_path, exist_ok=True)
    return redirect(url_for('index'))

@app.route('/category/delete/<category>', methods=['POST'])
def delete_category(category):
    category_path = os.path.join(app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'], category)
    if os.path.exists(category_path):
        import shutil
        shutil.rmtree(category_path)
    return redirect(url_for('index'))
6. User Interface Design
We'll use Bootstrap for styling.

Adjusting Static File Serving
Flask serves static files from the static directory by default. We need to adjust our application to serve uploaded images.

Modify app.py

Add the following to serve uploaded files during development:

python
Copy code
from flask import send_from_directory

@app.route('/uploads/<path:filename>')
def uploaded_file(filename):
    return send_from_directory(app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'], filename)
Update image URLs in category.html:

html
Copy code
<img src="{{ url_for('uploaded_file', filename=category + '/thumbnail/' + image) }}" class="card-img-top" alt="{{ image }}">

Users navigate to the upload page for a specific category.
The upload form allows selecting multiple photos simultaneously.
Accepted file extensions: .heic, .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .mov, .mp4.
Processing Uploaded Photos:

Uploaded photos are saved in the source subdirectory of the category.
Each photo is processed as follows:
HEIC Files: Read using pyheif and converted to an image object.
Other Formats: Opened using the Pillow library.
Transparency Handling: Images with transparency are converted to remove the alpha channel, replacing it with a white background.
Generating JPEG Variants:

For each image, the application generates three JPEG variants:
Largest: Resized to a maximum of 1920x1080 pixels (default, configurable).
Medium: Resized to a maximum of 1280x720 pixels (default, configurable).
Thumbnail: Resized to a maximum of 200x200 pixels (default, configurable).
Images are saved with a quality level specified by the IMAGE_QUALITY environment variable.
2. Category Management
Creating Categories:

Users can create new categories from the home page by entering a category name.
A directory is created under the upload directory for the new category.
Deleting Categories:

Users can delete categories, which removes the category directory and all its contents.
Directory Structure:

The application's upload directory is organized as follows:

bash
Copy code
uploads/
  category_name/
    source/
    largest/
    medium/
    thumbnail/
3. User Interface
